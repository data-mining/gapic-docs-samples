## 🎓 Code Sample Generation Tutorial

Please checkout the [Code Sample Generation Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)

In the tutorial, you  author a new code sample which calls the [Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/).

 - You update an existing configuration file to add a **new code sample**.
 - You generate the new code sample in **multiple programming languages**.
 - You **run the generated code** samples manually.
 - You configure **automated tests** to run this sample against the live API in all languages.
 - You **run the automated tests** against the generated code samples in multiple programming languages.

It's a great introduction to using GAPIC code sample generation and testing.
