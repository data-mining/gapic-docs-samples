## 🏆 Canonical Code Samples

This directory contains code samples in all languages which demonstrate various types of samples.

The samples here are intended to represent the _ideal_ output of the sample generator.

The samples here are intended to represent the _current standard_ of the hand-written samples.

 ###  Canonical Sample Examples

| Language | Synchronous | Long-running operation | File input | File output | Resource Paths |

#### Synchronous API Request

For this sample, we use a simple Natural Language API call for `AnalyzeSentiment`

#### Long-Running Operation

For this sample, we use Cloud Speech `LongRunningRecognize` with a GCS path to audio file

#### Local File Input Parameter

For this sample, we use Cloud Speech `Recognize` with a local file path to audio file
 
#### Project ID Resource Paths

For this sample, we use Dialogflow `CreateEntityType` which uses resource paths
